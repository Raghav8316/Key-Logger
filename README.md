# Key-logger

Key-logger is a Python-based **Keystroke Logging Tool** that captures and logs all keyboard activity on a system. It is designed to demonstrate the ethical use of keyloggers for cybersecurity and educational purposes.

## Features

- **Keystroke Capture**:  
  Records all keystrokes, including special keys (e.g., Shift, Enter, Backspace).
  
- **Secure Logging**:  
  Stores captured data in a secure file for analysis.

- **User-Friendly GUI**:  
  Integrated a simple and interactive graphical interface using Tkinter.

- **Educational Focus**:  
  Highlights the potential and risks associated with keyloggers, emphasizing their ethical use.

## How It Works

1. **Captures Keystrokes**:  
   Monitors and logs all keyboard inputs in real-time.

2. **Secure Data Storage**:  
   Saves the logged data in a protected file for review.

3. **Interactive GUI**:  
   A Tkinter-based interface simplifies usage and demonstrates the keylogger's capabilities.

4. **Ethical Purpose**:  
   Built as a learning tool for cybersecurity professionals to understand and counteract keylogging threats.

## Use Cases in Ethical Hacking

- **System Vulnerability Testing**:  
  Assess system weaknesses in controlled environments.

- **Attack Simulation**:  
  Recreate real-world keylogging scenarios to enhance defenses.

- **Education and Awareness**:  
  Train organizations on recognizing and mitigating keylogging threats.

## Understanding the Threat

Keyloggers, if misused, can pose serious security risks:
- **Stealing Sensitive Information**:  
  Capture passwords, personal data, and other confidential details.

- **Compromising Privacy**:  
  Undermines user privacy and system security.
